    q: "Is e-voting mandatory for all listed companies in India?",
    a: "Yes. Under Section 108 of the Companies Act 2013 read with Rule 20 of the Companies (Management and Administration) Rules 2014, and Regulation 44 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015, every listed company and every company having not less than 1,000 shareholders is statutorily mandated to provide a remote e-voting facility to its members for all general meetings."
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if a listed company doesn't provide e-voting facility?",
    a: "Failure to provide mandatory e-voting violates Section 108 and Section 450 of the Companies Act 2013, as well as SEBI LODR Regulations. Penalties include monetary fines on the company and officers in default (up to ₹10,000 with additional daily fines), potential invalidation of resolutions passed at the meeting, and SEBI regulatory enforcement actions."
  },
  {
    q: "Can shareholders vote after the AGM meeting starts?",
    a: "Yes. In accordance with MCA General Circulars and Rule 20(4)(viii), remote e-voting closes at 5:00 PM on the day immediately preceding the AGM. However, during the virtual or hybrid AGM, an venue e-voting (InstaPoll) window is made available so that members attending the meeting who did not cast their vote via remote e-voting can cast their ballots in real-time."
  },
  {
    q: "How is vote secrecy maintained in e-voting under Indian law?",
    a: "Rule 20(4)(xii) of the Companies Rules mandates that the register of votes cast cannot be accessed by the company or any third party before the voting closes. Vote India Secure enforces AES-256 bit ballot encryption and SHA-256 hash sealing. The encrypted ballots can only be unlocked by the designated independent Scrutinizer in the presence of at least two independent witnesses."
  },
  {
    q: "What is Form MGT-13 and when is it required?",
    a: "Form MGT-13 is the statutory Scrutinizer's Report prescribed under Rule 20(4)(xii) of the Companies (Management and Administration) Rules 2014. The Scrutinizer must prepare and submit this report to the Chairman or authorized Director within 2 working days of the general meeting conclusion, detailing votes cast in favor, against, and invalid votes for each resolution."
